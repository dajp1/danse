An ad-hoc and sensor network simulator designed for education

Orginally design for a first-year (freshman) module in networking, the emphasis is on 
visualisation and ease-of-use rather than simulation speed or flexibility (a lot of
protocols and variations can be investigated with no coding required at all).  Written 
in C# using WPF.

The source code and documentation is now here.  For more details, and some screen-shots showing
what the software looks like to the user, please visit: https://danse.gswce.net
